/**
 * potpack - by [@mourner](https://github.com/mourner)
 * 
 * A tiny JavaScript function for packing 2D rectangles into a near-square container, 
 * which is useful for generating CSS sprites and WebGL textures. Similar to 
 * [shelf-pack](https://github.com/mapbox/shelf-pack), but static (you can't add items 
 * once a layout is generated), and aims for maximal space utilization.
 *
 * A variation of algorithms used in [rectpack2D](https://github.com/TeamHypersomnia/rectpack2D)
 * and [bin-pack](https://github.com/bryanburgers/bin-pack), which are in turn based 
 * on [this article by Blackpawn](http://blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/default.html).
